# XOR Machine Learning #
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) which uses the **Keras API** to create Nerual Networks. Data is generated for these neural networks which mimicks the inputs and expected output of an **XOR logic gate** (This includes 2 binary features and 1 binary label).


**XOR_Predictor.model :** This file contains the weights and biases of the trained Neural Network.
