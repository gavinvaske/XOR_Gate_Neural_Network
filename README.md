# XOR Machine Learning #
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) which uses the Keras API to create various Nerual Networks. Data is generated for these neural networks which mimicks the inputs and expected output of an **XOR logic gate** (This includes 2 binary features and 1 binary label).

This file contains the weights and basis of the most accuracte model trained on the generated data and can be loaded into your machine    learning project.
